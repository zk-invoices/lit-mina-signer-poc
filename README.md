## Invoicez: Easy Wallet-Free Onboarding

## Project Background
The project began as part of a 6-month initiative during the Navigators Season 1 program, focused on developing a minimum viable product (MVP) for an invoice application. This application utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs and operates on the Mina protocol. The core concept of the project is centered around using recursive proofs to build a verifiable off-chain invoice repository. This repository is intended to be used on-chain for various applications, such as facilitating credit assessments or enabling on-chain invoice factoring.

The project's goal is to create a system where invoice data can be kept secure off-chain and still be confirmed via on-chain mechanisms, ensuring both data integrity and privacy. Through the use of the Mina protocol, the project satisfies critical invoicing system needs by balancing privacy with transparency.

## Proposal Overview

### Problem
One major challenge in onboarding Web2 users to decentralized apps is the need to install browser extensions and create wallet keys. This process creates friction, discouraging those unfamiliar with blockchain technology. Traditional users, used to seamless Web2 experiences, may find these technical steps daunting, leading to higher dropout rates and potential loss of users.

### Solution
Aiming to streamline the transition of Web2 users to Web3, this onboarding tool reduces technical complexities. It provides a simplified authentication process similar to 'Sign in with Google', allowing users easy access to decentralized apps. By making wallet creation and key management more intuitive, the tool seeks to improve user retention and expand the reach of decentralized applications to a broader audience.

This tool also aims to support the original `mina-provider`, enabling developers to build apps compatible with this solution alongside existing wallets like Auro Wallet.

### Impact
This proposal enhances the Mina ecosystem by lowering barriers for new users, thus encouraging broader adoption. By simplifying the onboarding process, it attracts more users who are traditionally hesitant about blockchain technology due to technical complexities. Additionally, it offers developers improved tools for integrating their applications, consequently fostering innovation and enabling novel applications within the Mina ecosystem.

### Audience
The target audience for this project primarily includes developers who are looking to create user-friendly decentralized apps. By providing tools that simplify onboarding, it empowers developers to design applications that are more accessible to users. Additionally, the project targets Web2 users interested in exploring decentralized applications but are deterred by complex onboarding processes, as well as businesses aiming to integrate Web3 elements without alienating their existing user base.
